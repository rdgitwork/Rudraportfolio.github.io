                        <p><strong>Used languages/technologies : Kali linux, Metasploit, Pfsene, Virtual Box </strong><br> In current semester we have subjects regarding networking and cyber security. I hope to learn everything from these subject as these
                            could be core for the networking, cloud and security.
                            <br> Now about this experimental hack, for this I have setup all the virtual machines in the virtual box such as kali, pfsense,metasploit. First Pfsense is a firewaal which keep separate the kali from my laptop. Metasploit
                            is here target and kali is the hacker both are connected to the pfsense same network. As kalilinux has many tools for networking and hacking. For this first I discovered the target ip as it was on the same network as kali and
                            then I open the backdoor and exploit the port. Boom hack is complete now i can control my target remotly from my kali linux. I also used one of kali scanning tool syper to scan the vulnaribilities of the website. This is just
                            the begining of the semester and hope to learn more and obtain comptia network+ certificate.

                        <p><strong>Used languages/technologies : C#, mysql</strong><br> This was the group project where we all have assigned diffrent roles. I was Project lead & developer, because it was pretty big project so every body has to code. We
                            plannd this project for one month and spent time on coding for one month.<br> This project included dynamic programming in c#, as c# wpf application can connect with the network. So we had two things one front-end and second
                            back-end which also coded into c#. First we have to start local c# server which listens to the requests of the application and work as a back-end server. We connected the application to the mysql by its private key and take
                            sql data table to full, show and change the information as per user input in the main application. This application was transport management system which manages the transporation of the parcels and ship containers. Where first
                            user have to fill the information then it has home menu where user can choose different options as like administartor, developer, buyer. Where each section ask for the credentials. Upon entering the credentials yser redirect
                            ot the interface. Such as buyer has option of available container, prices and track the order.

                        <p><strong>Used technologies : C#, Servieces, Azure.
                            </strong><br> This project compiles the use of microsoft services and azure. First I created a game where I have to guess the words from the given string. This application has two sides front end and backend where first we
                            have to run the server then front end connects to the server and give a random string from the available files. Then user have to guess and it counts how many words still user have to guess to win the game. Gmae can be disconnected
                            in the middle and it has time limit so if user failed to huess words in 10 minutes or so user will loose and get the option of play agaon or exit.
                            <br> That was the application description now the real use of azure was I have to upload the server side on the Azure and make the services of the server side code using poweshell. Now take the ip of azure and put that into
                            the game where it aska for the ip and port which will conncet to the server which is now on the cloud. So, basically we created server on the cloud for the game and app can run from any computer by simply enetring the ip and
                            port number of azure server.

                            This was a very basic website but very effective to learning the basics of the php and ASP.NET. In this website user enters to home page where he/she has to fill out personal information such as name and age. Then that website
                            redirect to the second page where it welcomes with the user's name and where user can select various animals from the list and upon clicking on any animal name it will redirect to another page which shows the selected animals
                            various inamges and facts of the animal. I used php and asp.net as a backend langauges which helps multipage redirection process as well as create only single page for the display which can fir any selected animal information
                            once at a time. Ih ave hosted this website on local IIS server via localhost.
